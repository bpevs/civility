Civility is a library for making websites and applications, inspired by my learnings in [Zuck](https://github.com/Blanket-Warriors/Zuck).


Goals
=====
  - Built piece-by-piece; Always have the project in a usable state.
  - Overridable UI using functional css React components
  - Pre-built [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) store with a core of extendable actions, reducers, middleware
  - Swappable services built on [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) specs
  - Services and components to be OOTB compatible with [next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) and [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), but extensible to other platforms.
